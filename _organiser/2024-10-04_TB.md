## Report
TechProbe, held from October 4<sup>th</sup> to October 28<sup>th</sup>, 2024, was a comprehensive cybersecurity awareness initiative aimed at educating participants about the importance of cybersecurity and promoting safe online practices. 
The event focused on empowering individuals with the knowledge needed to protect themselves from digital threats, including phishing, password security, and data protection.
The event is a <b>Cybersecurity Quiz Challenge</b>, which ran throughout the month via the Instagram handle <b>Cyber Awareness Month (@avvcyber_cam)</b>.
<br>
Every alternative day, four cybersecurity-related questions were posted, starting at 8 PM, with a 5-minute interval between each question. 
These questions tested participants on a wide range of topics, including password security, basic cryptography, phishing scams, and safe online behaviours. <br>
The questions were selected based on specific events and topics related to cybersecurity and the speciality of that day. Some interesting topics on which we had themed the quiz included National Lovers Day, Nut day, Cerebral Palsy Day and more.<br>
The difficulty of the questions varied from easy to moderate difficulty to engage both beginners and those with more advanced knowledge of Cybersecurity.
