# Report

## Introduction
The Escape Room Event, titled **"Unsolved"**, was organized as part of the Anokha Tech Fair by the WiCyS Amrita Student Chapter on 17th, 18th and 19th of October. The primary objective was to promote awareness of cybersecurity principles in a fun and interactive manner while challenging participants to think critically under pressure. The event was designed to engage participants in solving puzzles and tasks related to cyber safety, cryptography, and logical reasoning, all while racing against the clock.

## Planning Phase
The planning began weeks in advance, with brainstorming sessions by our volunteers Anagha B Prasanth, Appaka Vibhika Krishna Raghavani, Devinandha, Madhumitha Sivakumar, Shobhana S, Chenna Kushala Sree and Karun A T focused on identifying key requirements and laying out the framework for the event. The main requirements we focused on were:
- Designing puzzles and challenges that revolved around cybersecurity themes.
- Setting up a realistic escape room environment to create an immersive experience.
- Defining roles for volunteers to guide and assist participants.
- Ensuring logistical readiness, including securing props, materials, and technical equipment.

Our execution plan involved breaking the event into three stages:
1. **Entry and Orientation**: Welcoming and briefing participants about the storyline, rules, and objectives.
2. **Escape Room Challenge**: Participants worked as teams to solve a series of puzzles leading to their “escape” and finding the culprit.
3. **Feedback and Survey**: After completing the challenge, participants gave their feedback through volunteers and were later encouraged to take part in a survey related to Human Factors influencing the choice of passwords. Interested participants were also invited to register for the new member induction program scheduled for December.



## Execution Phase
The actual event execution involved meticulous coordination. Volunteers played a critical role in guiding participants and monitoring their progress without giving away solutions. The technical aspects, team registration, and puzzle completion verification were handled seamlessly by the organizing team.



## Final Resources Used
The following resources were utilized during the event:
- **Physical Props**: Clues, chart papers, cardboard boxes, locks, and cipher sheets.
- **Digital Tools**: Online platforms for registration and survey submissions, and virtual puzzles.
- **Volunteers**: A team of dedicated members from both 1st and 2nd years assisted participants at various stages.
- **Infrastructure**: A themed room with dim lighting to enhance the immersive experience.

2. **Interactive Experience**: The immersive storyline and challenging tasks kept participants motivated and intrigued.
3. **Incentives**: Participants were encouraged through prizes for the highest scores.
